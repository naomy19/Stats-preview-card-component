## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through this project I could practice what I have learned about HTML (sections and divs), CSS (flexbox) and responsive design.
Also, I could learn about background-blend-mode.

### Continued development

I will continue to practice flexbox, position and widths/heights.

### Useful resources

- [Cole Steele's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF_Xl5TOGlY&list=PLblA84xge2_xNtaFnZhefjFbnDrpySKD3) - I highly recommend Cole Steele videos, this is the link for a playlist "Learn Code from Scratch". His videos helped understand more about CSS (flexbox, units and media queries).
